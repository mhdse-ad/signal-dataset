There is 2 datasets 1 normal data and 1 imbalance(I used 6g and 10g) data.The preprocess is cleaning data + Use Neural network model in order to classify normal and imbalance data. AS far as it did not have any features, I nee to use windowing and feature extraction.
Then I used feature importance to figure out which feature is more important.After that I used Hyper parameter tunning.At the end I used LSTM neural network model.
